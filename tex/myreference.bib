Then we will identify the concepts within the piece that introduce this new dimension of "musical construction". From a theoretical analysis of the specific examples and applications in the piece, we will induce and introduce a general conceptual framework for musical composition through physical modeling and will explain in the last section the fundamental "paradigm shift" to which it corresponds.},

abstract = {A study of the trumpet tone quality has been undertaken to determine the important physical correlates of trumpet timbre. Musical fragments played by a professional trumpet player have been recorded; selected tones have been converted into digital form by sampling at 10‐kcps rate for subsequent spectral analysis. The computer analysis has yielded displays of the amplitude of each harmonic as a function of time (one point per fundamental pitch period). From these displays and computer sound‐generation programs, tones were synthetized that proved to be indistinguishable from the real tones by skilled musicians. By systematically altering the tones' parameters, it was found that a few physical features were of utmost aural importance: the attack time (which is shorter for the low‐frequency harmonics than for the high‐frequency ones), the fluctuation of the pitch frequency (which is of small amplitude, fast, and quasirandom), the harmonic content (which becomes richer in high‐frequency harmonic when the loudn...},

How the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of the width of the frequency‐range by the time it is available. Several illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are included. In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to that commonly used for variations with time.},
