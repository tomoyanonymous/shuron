abstract = {メディア考古学とは、万華鏡、覗きからくり、ジオラマのような、淘汰され、多くは失われてしまった過去のメディアの再考察を通して、メディア全般への理解を深めようとする試みである。技術決定論的・単線的・目的論的な進歩史観から脱し、複数の異なるメディア文化の過去と現在を対話させようというその問題意識は、現代のメディアアーティストたちにも影響を与えている。本書はメディア考古学の第一人者であるエルキ・フータモ教授の代表的な論文を集めた、日本独自編集のアンソロジーである。メディア考古学の理論的背景やその射程、具体的なメディア考古学の実践、さらには現代アートとメディア考古学の関連など、多彩な論考を収めている。メディア考古学への最良の道案内となるであろう。},

abstract = {This text is an investigation into media culture, temporalities of media objects and planned obsolescence in the midst of ecological crisis and electronic waste. The authors approach the topic under the umbrella of media archaeology and aim to extend this historiographically oriented field of media theory into a methodology for contem- porary artistic practice. Hence, media archaeology becomes not only a method for excavation of repressed and forgotten media discourses, but extends itself into an artistic method close to Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culture, cir- cuit bending, hardware hacking and other hacktivist exercises that are closely related to the political economy of informa- tion technology. The concept of dead media is discussed as “zombie media”—dead media revitalized, brought back to use, reworked.},

abstract = {First edition. Includes index. "Springing from the febrile mind of mathematician Norbert Wiener amid the devastation of World War II, the cybernetic vision underpinned a host of seductive myths about the future of machines. This vision would radically transform the postwar world, ushering in sweeping cultural change. From the Cold War's monumental SAGE bomber defense system to enhanced humans, Wiener's scheme turned computers from machines of assured destruction into engines of brilliant utopias. Cybernetics triggered blissful cults, the Whole Earth Catalog, and feminist manifestos, just as it fueled martial gizmos and the air force's foray into virtual space. As Rid shows, Cybernetics proved a powerful tool for two competing factions-- those who sought to make a better world and those who sought to control the one at hand. In the Bay Area, techno-libertarians embraced networked machines as the portal to a new electronic frontier: a peaceful, open space of freedom. In Washington, DC, cyberspace provided the perfect theater for dominance and war. Meanwhile the future arrived secretly in 1996, with Moonlight Maze, dawn of a new age of digital state-on-state espionage. That "first cyberwar" ... went on for years-- and indeed has never stopped. In our long-promised cybernetic future, the line between utopia and dystopia continues to be disturbingly thin."--Jacket flap.

Musical fragments played by a professional trumpet player have been recorded; selected tones have been converted into digital form by sampling at 10‐kcps rate for subsequent spectral analysis. The computer analysis has yielded displays of the amplitude of each harmonic as a function of time (one point per fundamental pitch period). From these displays and computer sound‐generation programs, tones were synthetized that proved to be indistinguishable from the real tones by skilled musicians. By systematically altering the tones' parameters, it was found that a few physical features were of utmost aural importance: the attack time (which is shorter for the low‐frequency harmonics than for the high‐frequency ones), the fluctuation of the pitch frequency (which is of small amplitude, fast, and quasirandom), the harmonic content (which becomes richer in high‐frequency harmonic when the loudn...},

abstract = {A quantitative measure of “information” is developed which is based on physical as contrasted with psychological considerations. How the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of the width of the frequency‐range by the time it is available. Several illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are included. In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to that commonly used for variations with time.},

abstract = {MP3: The Meaning of a Format recounts the hundred-year history of the world's most common format for recorded audio. Understanding the historical meaning of the MP3 format entails rethinking the place of digital technologies in the larger universe of twentieth-century communication history, from hearing research conducted by the telephone industry in the 1910s, through the mid-century development of perceptual coding (the technology underlying the MP3), to the format's promiscuous social life since the mid 1990s. MP3s are products of compression, a process that removes sounds unlikely to be heard from recordings. Although media history is often characterized as a progression toward greater definition, fidelity, and truthfulness, MP3: The Meaning of a Format illuminates the crucial role of compression in the development of modern media and sound culture. Taking the history of compression as his point of departure, Jonathan Sterne investigates the relationships among sound, silence, sense, and noise; the commodity status of recorded sound and the economic role of piracy; and the importance of standards in the governance of our emerging media culture. He demonstrates that formats, standards, and infrastructures--and the need for content to fit inside them--are every bit as central to communication as the boxes we call "media." Introduction : format theory -- Perceptual technics -- Nature builds no telephones -- Perceptual coding and the domestication of noise -- Making a standard -- Of MPEG, measurement, and men -- Is music a thing? -- Conclusion : the end of MP3.},

The aim of the project is to embody a "present" by re-reading the history with practices. By utilizing the literature of media archaeology as our foothold, we firstly deepen our understanding of the role and function of various media, especially in the field of audio and visual, before their stabilization in the history. Then, we apply each acquired notion as a technique for diverse aesthetic practices in the era of personal fabrication. Instead of depicting the future or excavating the past, we try to redefine the reality of our circumstances by producing the alternatives. In this presentation, through the particular works of those techniques, we summarize the activities of this project based on related materials that focus on introducing the details of the exhibition shown at the NTT Intercommunication Center's (ICC) Open Space 2015.},
